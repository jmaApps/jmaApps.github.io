    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> <p>
        <h4>Last updated August 26, 2022</h4>
            This page describes how and why we might collect, 
            store and/or share your information when you use our Services. 
            Usage of our services is defined as:
            <ul>
                <li>Download and utilize our mobile application, iReplica.</li>
                <li>Download and utilize any software of ours that links to this privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
    </p>    <p>
                  iReplica is a camera-based application. This app was developed by the jma team as a Free app. This app allows the user to capture photos in RAW and then process them in either the standard image processing pipline or our custom ONOFF processing pipeline.
                  The primary purpose of this app is to be able to capture a photo, and, by processing the RAW, be able to replicate a very close representation of what the human eye sees. In short, make the photo look as realistic as possible.  
                  The app is currently in its initial stages, we will be improving the application regularly so stay tuned!
                  Another purpose of this app is to provide image adjustment data for vision research in order to better understand the sense of sight. This Service is provided by
                  the jma team at no cost and is intended for use as is.
                  If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. The Personal Information that we collect is
                  used for providing and improving the Service.
            </p>
            <p>We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only 
                have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email. We will not sell or rent this information 
                to anyone.</p>

         <p><strong>What personal information do we collect and use?</strong> We do not collect,
        use, save, or have access to any of your personal information. For
        mailing your adjustment preferences if you chose to contribute, you are requested to have a valid email address in order to send an email. We have no
        usage of that address and it is not shared with anyone.</p>
        <p><strong>Do we collect any data automatically?</strong> There is no automatic collection of information. If the service requries any data, 
          it will explicitly request it from the user. </p>

         <br>
         <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3> <p>
          We do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data recorded in iReplica for iOS. Individual settings relating to the  
          iReplica App are not personal and are stored only on your device. There is no automatic collection of information. If any data or information is to be colleted, the user will explicitly be informed about it.
           We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
           <br>
           <br>
           Since iReplica is a camera-based application, the main privacy points revolve around the captured image's content and location.
           <br>
           <ul><li><strong>Camera, Photos, and Audio.</strong> Our service requires us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. 
            For example, you won’t be able to capture or upload photos to your camera roll unless we can 
            access your camera or photos. The application does NOT support Audio. Only the user has access
             to the captured image. We only have access to upload the photo to your Photos App, when you request so. We 
             have no access to your content in your Photos. As soon as you close the application, or cancel 
             the image, the image is forever deleted. </li>
             <br> 
            <li><strong>Location Information.</strong> When you use our services we will never collect information about your location.</li>
            <br> 
            <li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies, Log, and Other Technologies.</strong> We do NOT collect any information from cookies, logs, or any other technologies. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Device Information.</strong>  We collect minimal non-personal information from and about the devices you use. The only information that we collect from
            the device is your screen brightness. The only information we collect about the device are: hardware model and minimal information on the devices sensor: (i.e. Aperture & Exposure). 
            This collection of information is only done if the user consents to contributing to our research. 
            More on this in the next paragraph.</li>
            <br> 
            <li><strong>Device Content.</strong> We collect minimal non-personal information on the your experience with the application. The only information we collect about the content are editing perferences such as your choice of gamma correction, contrast, alpha, and weight. 
                This collection of information is only done if the user consents to contributing to our research. 
                More on this in the next paragraph.</li>
            </ul>
           <br>
           After you successfully save the photos in your Photos, you will be prompted with an option to contribute to our vision research. 
           This contribution is done in the form of mailing a csv file, populated with data (more on what data is included down below), 
           to our laboratory. In order to mail the data to us, you must have a valid email address connected to your Mail App. Once we 
           receive the contribution, we will process the csv file and delete the email, removing any trace to your email address. 
           The email address is not collected, stored, or shared in any way. In the Mail Composer, you will see the recipient as our 
           laboratory email, if you would like to receive a copy of the csv datasheet, simply add your email address to the recipients. 
           The email address will be retained to your device and we will have no access to it. We will simply receive a copy of your 
           adjustment preferences, anonymously, for vision research or to develop future clinical applications. If you would like to restrain 
           from sending an anonymous copy of your adjustment preferences  to our laboratory, simply delete our email address in the Mail 
           Composer, or refrain from contributing. The following data will be in the csv datasheet, none of which is linked to your identity:
                </p> 
             <ul><li>A session ID which is nothing more than the applications name with a randomly generated number;</li> 
                <li>The processing method used when saving the photos;</li>
                 <li><strong>Non-personal Device Information.</strong>
                        <ul><li>Screen brightness;</li>
                            <li>Lens Model (i.e. iPhone 8 back camera 3.99m f/1.8);</li>
                            <li>Information from the device's sensors: Brightness, Aperture, ISO, and Exposure;</li>
                        </ul>
                </li> 
                <li><strong>Non-personal information on the Processing Used.</strong> 
                        <ul><li>Black level, white level, and white balance;</li>
                            <li>Color conversion matrix;</li> 
                            <li>Both of which are public information and hardware model specific;</li> 
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Non-personal Information on the adjustment preferences.</strong> 
                    <ul><li>The contrast, brightness, and gamma correction values used in the standard processing;</li>
                        <li>The alpha, beta, and weight values used in the ONOFF processing;</li> 
                        <li>Your identity is not linked to these values, it is completely anonymous;</li> 
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Histograms of captured photo's rgb pixel intensities.</strong>
                       <ul><li>Simply a list that is 255 items in length, for each color channel (red, green, blue);</li>
                           <li>Each item in the list represents the number of pixels across the image that had the same intensity as the item’s number in the order. (i.e. if the image has red and very bright, it would have 0’s in most of the list, and a couple of hundred thousands in the 240-255 range);</li>
                           <li>This is in NO way a representation of the image, nor is it possible to replicate the image captured from these counters;</li>
                       </ul>
                 </li> 
            </ul>
