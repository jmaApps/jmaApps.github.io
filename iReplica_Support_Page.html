                    If you've ever wanted to capture a photo that closely resembles what your eyes see, 
                    then iReplica is just the app for you. iReplica provides users with the ability to both 
                    capture and save photos in RAW, while also providing two different processing pipelines to 
                    adjust the image. We are regularly improving on the application's mechanics so stay tuned for new updates.

                    The camera application is inspired by work from the laboratory of Dr. Alonso. 
                    The app is written by Adam Khoukhi, who is supervised by Hamed Nasrabadi,

                    The Capture Photos stage is, simply, where you will capture the photo. iReplica captures photos in RAW.

                    What is RAW? A RAW file is simply a digital negative image file that is minimally processed 
                    and is usually uncompressed. When capturing with RAW, the user captures all image data 
                    recorded by the sensor. So why capture in RAW? There isn’t really a downside to capturing in 
                    RAW, except a larger file size. When capturing in RAW, you get the highest level of quality, easily 
                    adjust exposure, brightness, and white balance, and you get much better detail.    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Under the viewfinder display is the capture adjustment segment selector. By simply clicking, or swiping to the selected segment, 
                    the user can adjust the exposure steps to be used when capturing the photos. Select the correct segment depending on whether you 
                    are indoors or outdoors. This selection will help us better understand the ambient light in your environment, which will prompt 
                    you with a slider to adjust the photo’s exposure. The application uses HDR (High Dynamic Range) and captures 4 of the same image with different exposures, 
                    3 of which will be relative to the captured photo with the selected shutter speed.

                    Once you capture a photo, the application starts processing the RAW sensor data. 
                    If you would like the RAW data yourself, no worries, you can save the RAW photo alone or with the processed image. While the screen has a loading page, 
                    the application first reads the unprocessed sensor data. It then applies black level so the image doesn’t 
                    look saturated, and applies white balance so that white looks white and not green or yellow. Once the color is correct, 
                    the application demosaics the Bayer pattern and applies the appropriate color space conversion. Lastly, HDR is 
                    implemented in order to get the best the best detail possible in the photo's light and dark areas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once the processing is complete, a view will appear similar to the one you see here. This means the processing is done, 
                    and you now have the choice to further process the captured image in 2 methods as displayed in the top part of the image. 
                    You may switch the processing method by simply clicking or swiping to the desired method in the segment selector. You can 
                    always switch back to a different method, your progress will be saved (two copies of the image, one for each method). 
                    You can also click on the reset button in the bottom left of the image if you would like to remove all editing done on 
                    the selected method.

                    <br>
                    Currently selected is the standard method. This method applies what is commonly applied, a gamma correction. In this method, 
                    you will be able to process the image by adjusting its gamma correction, saturation, and lightness. The saturation and lightness 
                    are from the HSL model. Saturation is a percentage value that describes the intensity of the color. Gamma, also known as Gamma 
                    correction, is a nonlinear operation on the luminance: (1.8-2.2 is the ideal range). Lastly, lightness is a percentage value 
                    that describes how much light you want to give the color.

                    The other method, ONOFF, is our custom method that is based on how our eyes biologically process what we see. The 
                    best-resulting values vary heavily based on the image so a little more tweaking is necessary for this method. 
                    BG is the percentile value describing the ON and OFF backgrounds. The percentile is based on the image's maximum 
                    luminance. Next,  nON maps the ON luminance values with a non-linear gamma function to the power of 1 over the value 
                    selected. On the other hand, nOFF maps the OFF luminance values with a non-linear gamma function to the power of the 
                    value selected. ω specifies the relative ON and OFF response strength. Lastly, S maps the upper S percentile of the 
                    ON luminance values with a non-linear gamma function to power between nON & nOFF. For further information on that, 
                    please refer to the article

                    Once you're done editing, you can now save the photo to your Photos by clicking the save button on the top right corner. 
                    There, you will have 3 saving choices; save only the captured RAW photo in RAW; this will save a DNG file, 
                    about 12 MB in size, in your Photos. The preview that you see for the RAW is simply a jpg preview. Click on the Processed if you would like to only save your processing of the captured photo. 
                    This will save a png file that looks identical to the image displayed on your screen. If you would like to save both, then click on RAW+Processed.
