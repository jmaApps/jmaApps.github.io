         <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3> <p>
          We do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data recorded in Eye Speed for iOS. Individual settings relating to the Eye 
          Speed App are not personal and are stored only on your device. There is no automatic collection of information. If any data or information is to be colleted, the user will explicitly be informed about it.
           We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
           <br>
           <br>
          When the trials are completed, there is an option to mail the data to our laboratory and to the user's email address. 
          In order to mail you the data, we request that you provide a valid email address that is used as a destination point. The data will be mailed in the form of a data sheet that contains information about the data collected (e.g., 
          reaction times and correct responses for individual trials) and information about the variables selected for the test. The variables can be set before the test begins (e.g., size of noise, size of spots, ratio of black and white area, 
          number of trials). The email address that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected, stored, or shared in any way. In the Mail Composer, you will see two additional email addresses to the one you provided; our laboratories.
          Both addresses will not have access to any of your personal information. They will simply receive a copy of your performance results, anonymously, for vision research or to develop future clinical applications. If you would like to restrain from sending an anonymous copy of your trial 
          results to our laboratory, simply delete the email addresses in the Mail Composer.
